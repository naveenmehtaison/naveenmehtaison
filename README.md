👨‍💻 About Me

[🔗 My Portfolio](https://naveenmehta-portfolio.netlify.app)

I'm a Full Stack Developer Intern with hands-on experience in building applications using .NET Core, Angular, React, and SQL Server.
I also enjoy experimenting with the MERN stack, continuously expanding my skills, and bringing ideas to life with clean and efficient code.

💡 Currently, I’m working on:

⚡ Angular + .NET Core Web API for enterprise-level apps

🛠 Dapper ORM + Stored Procedures for optimized backend performance

🗄 SQL Server for secure and efficient data management

🔥 React.js for interactive and responsive UIs

🎨 Tailwind + Bootstrap for modern styling

🚀 Exploring Node.js & MongoDB as part of the MERN stack journey

⚡ Always learning, always building — from SQL queries to scalable full-stack apps. Let’s connect and create something awesome!

Would you like me to also make separate “Tech Stack Badges” (like little logos for Angular, React, .NET, SQL, Node.js) for your GitHub README / Portfolio? That would make it look more professional.
